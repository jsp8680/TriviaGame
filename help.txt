Trivia Game Breakdown:

The game is quite simple but here are the requirements:

The game is completely created with Java so the only things needed is a:
- JDK(Java Development Kit) and an IDE
You can get it from Oracle here: https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/
Download the correct one for your OS.
Then you'll follow the installation instructions. 

The next step is to decide which IDE you want to use.

- Some options: Visual Studio Code, NetBeans and Eclipse.

Eclipse Tutorial: https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html

You can also go to GIT Hub with this link and run it with Codespaces.
https://github.com/jsp8680/TriviaGame

If you click the green <> Code button you can create a workspace with Codespaces that opens up in your browser.
Codespaces is a much simpler way to run this game as you don't have to download anything.
You just have to login or sign up to access it on GIT Hub to access it.
You do have to download the extension pack for Java to start the game.

All IDE's have a run and debug function and clicking it will run the game as long as you start it with the Main.java file.


To Start: 
You have to run the Main.java to play the game.

The controls:

a,b,c,d are all used to answer the question. 
If you put any other option it will be marked as incorrect but you may have a second chance if you have more than 3 stars.

50 is used to start 50-50.
S is used to use a second chance.
yes is used to continue playing.

If prompted you can enter a certain value like S or yes but you also will be given the option to move on by entering any other letter.


Levels: 
Are used to gain stars and to move on to more difficult questions after rank 6 you move on to more difficult questions
and after level 12 you move on to the hardest difficultly which includes both hard and normal difficultly questions.
You have to stop the program at certain intervals to move on to the more difficult questions but all level ups, experience and stars will be saved.

Experience: 
Your experience is based on how many points earned and if you win or not.
Points * 20 = experience 
If you win you gain 50 points.

Stars: 
You earn stars by leveling up, each level gives you 3 stars to use for 50-50 or to give you a second chance.

50-50:
You can only use 50-50 if you have more than 3 stars.
It takes away two incorrect answers to give you a higher chance of getting it correct.
You can only use 50-50 before answering not after.
After using it 3 stars will be removed.

Second Chance: 
You can only use Second Chance if you have more than 3 stars.
It gives you a retry after you get a question wrong.
You can only use it if you are prompted after you get a question wrong.
After using it 3 stars will be removed.
